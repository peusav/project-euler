## ⚙️ About

This repository contains my personal solutions written in **Python 3**.  
Each problem file follows a consistent naming pattern for clarity and order:

p001.py,
p002.py,
p003.py
...

The goal here isn’t just to get the correct answers, but to explore:

- 🧩 **Mathematical insight** — understanding the reasoning behind each challenge  
- ⚡ **Efficient algorithms** — prioritizing performance and elegance  
- 🧼 **Clean, readable code** — clarity over cleverness
